## **Mission**

To facilitate large-scale adoption of open, reproducible and responsible science practices within the University of Groningen (UG) and the University Medical Center (UMCG). Examples of practices are, but not limited to:

* Open Access publishing
* Preregistration
* Publishing null-findings
* Replication
* Sharing data & code

## **Aim**

The OSCG aims to make research more accessible and reproducible by:

* Facilitating Open Science Practices (through workshops, lectures, and materials on our website)
* Connecting Open Science enthusiasts and uniting current Open Science initiatives
* Stimulating responsible research practices and Open Science policies

## **Target group**

Our target group are researchers and students who are open and curious with regards to open science, but as of yet, have little to no experience with open science practices. It is within this group that we see an opportunity to facilitate the transition to open access and open science at a large scale, although researchers with more experience with open science are also more than welcome. OSCG is a platform where these researchers and students can acquire new skills, share their expertise, and articulate the support they need to make the transition to open science. Within the community, researchers connect with each other, as well as with open science experts and facilitators such as the library, the Research Support department, and the Open Access and Open Science projects. Moreover, OSCG makes open science more visible and accessible, both within and outside of UG and UMCG.
