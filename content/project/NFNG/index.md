Between 2013 and 2017, together with the No Fun No Glory [Team](https://nofunnoglory.nl/en/research-group), I collected biopsychosocial data on anhedonia for a project called ["No Fun, No Glory"](https://nofunnoglory.nl/en). Want to know exactly what variables we collected? [Download our codebook!](https://osf.io/z4py5/)

Using the data obtained through Experience Sampling Methods, I wrote [my PhD thesis](https://docs.wixstatic.com/ugd/c22377_f6d9d466111c42e8a75ce6c4cbced4a7.pdf) on anhedonia.

Please visit our project website for [more information](http://nofunnoglory.nl/en/), 
or email me or one of [my colleagues](https://nofunnoglory.nl/en/research-group) if you would be interested in using our data!
