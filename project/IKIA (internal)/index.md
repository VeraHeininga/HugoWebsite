Every Child is Different is a large Dutch crowdsourcing study into the relationship between happiness and unhappiness in children and young people, and the role of upbringing in this. Children, young people and parents can participate in the survey by completing questionnaires on this website. In this project we investigate whether you can also be happy if you sometimes (or regularly) have problems, such as stress, gloominess or stomach pain. We also want to know how important it is to be happy and how parents teach their children to deal with unhappiness.
